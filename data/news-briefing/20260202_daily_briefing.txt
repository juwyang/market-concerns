### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Dollar Dominance:** A sharply stronger US dollar, driven by strong economic data and Fed policy expectations, was a primary headwind for many commodities.
- **Broad Commodity Weakness:** The commodity complex exhibited widespread losses, described as having a "red glow," particularly in energy, grains, and softs.
- **Geopolitical Calm Weighs on Oil:** Easing tensions with Iran contributed significantly to the sharp decline in crude oil prices.
- **Supply Factors Diverge:** Markets reacted to specific supply-side news: recovering natural gas production pressured prices, while slowed cocoa deliveries provided support.
- **Livestock Bucks the Trend:** Cattle markets rallied on fundamental supply data, standing out against the generally weaker commodity backdrop.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. A partial US government shutdown could spark safe-haven demand in metals.
2. Escalating U.S.-Iran tensions could reverse the sell-off in crude oil and boost safe-haven assets.
3. The potential for supply disruptions in key agricultural regions (e.g., cocoa deliveries, Brazilian coffee weather).

### **Watch Next**
1. Confirmation and market reaction to the nomination of Keven Warsh as Fed Chair.
2. Further US economic data releases following the strong manufacturing news.
3. The USDA's Cattle Inventory Report and its continued impact on the live cattle market.
4. Geopolitical developments regarding Iran.
