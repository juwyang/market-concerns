### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Dollar Dominance:** The US dollar rallied sharply on news of a perceived hawkish nominee for Fed Chair, creating broad downward pressure on dollar-denominated commodities like precious metals and wheat.
- **Weather & Geopolitics Drive Energy:** Natural gas surged on cold US weather, while crude oil gave up early gains linked to Iran tensions after presidential rhetoric softened.
- **Softs Face Fundamental Headwinds:** Sugar and cocoa extended declines due to long-term surplus and demand concerns, while coffee fell on short-term weather forecasts for Brazil.
- **Grain and Livestock Markets Mixed:** These sectors saw generally weaker closes to end January, with specific drivers often not cited, though cattle found support from a strong cash market.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1.  **Monetary Policy Risk:** The nomination of a hawkish Fed Chair (Keven Warsh) introduces uncertainty and potential for a stronger dollar and higher rates, pressuring assets like precious metals.
2.  **Weather Dependency:** Natural gas and coffee prices are highly sensitive to immediate weather patterns (US cold, Brazil rain), which can change rapidly.
3.  **Geopolitical Swing Factor:** Crude oil prices demonstrated sensitivity to shifts in rhetoric regarding Middle East tensions, highlighting ongoing volatility risk.

### **Watch Next**
1.  **Confirmation & Policy Signals:** Market reaction to further details and confirmation hearings for the new Fed Chair nominee.
