### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Broad commodity weakness, with bears in control across grains, softs, and energy.
- Weather was a key driver: warm US forecasts pressured nat-gas, while beneficial rains in Brazil and West Africa hammered coffee and cocoa.
- Demand concerns weighed on crude oil and influenced "sell the fact" behavior in soybeans despite Chinese buying.
- The US dollar weakened on soft manufacturing data ahead of a key jobs report.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Weak Chinese energy demand impacting crude oil prices.
2. Volatility in soft commodities (coffee, cocoa, sugar) due to weather patterns and production changes.
3. General "heavy" sentiment in agricultural futures markets.

### **Watch Next**
1. Tuesday's US November payrolls report (influencing dollar and broader sentiment).
2. Further Chinese purchase announcements for agricultural commodities.
3. Continued evolution of US weather forecasts for natural gas demand.
