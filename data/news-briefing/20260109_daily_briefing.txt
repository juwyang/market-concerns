### **Summary & Key Themes**
- The **US Dollar strengthened** on shifting Fed expectations, pressuring dollar-denominated commodities like sugar.
- **Geopolitical tensions** (Iran protests) provided a sharp boost to crude oil prices.
- **Weather was a key driver**, with warm forecasts hammering natural gas and rain forecasts easing coffee supply concerns.

### **Risks Highlighted**
