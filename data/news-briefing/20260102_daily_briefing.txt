### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Supply Concerns Dominate:** Several commodities fell due to ample or increasing supply outlooks, including crude oil (global surplus), sugar (higher Indian production), and cocoa (favorable West African weather).
- **Weather-Driven Moves:** Energy markets were notably affected by weather, with warmer US forecasts pressuring natural gas prices.
- **Currency Impact:** Forex and commodity markets interacted, with a stronger Brazilian Real supporting coffee prices via short covering, while dollar strength was a headwind for other assets.
- **Livestock Divergence:** Cattle rallied on strong cash market activity, while hogs weakened amid thin holiday-week trading volume.
- **Grain Weakness:** Soybeans, corn, and wheat started the new year with broadly softer trade, though specific catalysts were not detailed.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1.  The risk of a sustained global oil glut weighing on energy prices.
2.  The risk that above-normal US temperatures continue to suppress natural gas demand.
3.  The risk that improved crop conditions in key growing regions (e.g., West Africa for cocoa, India for sugar) lead to larger-than-expected harvests.
4.  The risk of thin, illiquid trading conditions distorting price discovery, as seen in the hog market.

### **Watch Next**
1.  The upcoming release of Church & Dwight's Q4 earnings report.
2.  Further developments in the cash cattle market for price trend confirmation.
3.  USDA price reports and trading volume returning to normal after the holiday period.
