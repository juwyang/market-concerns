### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Risk-Off Dominates:** A clear risk-off sentiment prevailed, driving equity markets lower, boosting the US dollar as a safe-haven, and weighing on crude oil.
- **Grain Complex Rally:** Despite the broader risk-off tone, wheat, soybeans, and corn posted solid gains, supported by spillover buying within the sector.
- **Softs Diverge:** Coffee rallied on currency-driven short-covering, while sugar and cocoa plunged further due to persistent oversupply and weak demand.
- **Livestock Under Pressure:** Hog futures extended losses, and cattle futures were mixed in quiet trade.
