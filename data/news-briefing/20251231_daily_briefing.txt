### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Broad commodity weakness marked the final trading day of 2025, particularly in energy (crude, nat-gas) and grains (soybeans, wheat).
- The strengthening US Dollar, driven by positive labor data and higher yields, acted as a headwind for dollar-denominated assets like crude oil and precious metals.
- Livestock markets were mixed, with cattle finishing strong but hogs slipping.
- Soft commodities (sugar, cocoa) showed resilience, supported by technical factors and underlying supply concerns.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Oversupply conditions in energy markets, notably crude oil and natural gas, continue to pressure prices.
2. Warm US weather forecasts pose a downside risk to natural gas demand and pricing.
3. High volatility is expected to persist in metals markets.

### **Watch Next**
1. Market closure on Thursday, January 1st, for New Year's Day.
2. Post-holiday market reaction and any new fundamental data or reports.
3. Weather patterns, as they directly impact natural gas demand and agricultural growing conditions.
