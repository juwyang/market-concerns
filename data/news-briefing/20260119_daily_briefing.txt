### Daily Financial Briefing: 20260119

#### **Livestock**
1.  **Live Cattle**
    - **Price Movement:** Positioned for another leg higher, eyes new highs.
    - **Key Drivers:** Tight supply conditions are expected to persist into 2026. This is driven by a legacy of drought and minimal retention of heifers for herd rebuilding.
    - **Reverse Factors:** A significant change in herd expansion plans or unexpected, large-scale demand destruction could alter the supply outlook. The article notes there is "no quick relief in sight."
    - **Classification:** Long-term influencer - UP

#### **Metals**
1.  **Gold**
    - **Price Movement:** Trading at or near record highs.
    - **Key Drivers:** Policy, currency, and geopolitical risks are pushing investors toward hard assets as a hedge. A specific mention is made of actions by the US president causing global market chaos over a weekend.
    - **Reverse Factors:** A de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, a shift toward more hawkish monetary policy that strengthens the US dollar, or a sustained decline in safe-haven demand could pressure prices.
    - **Classification:** Long-term influencer - UP
2.  **Silver**
    - **Price Movement:** Moved to record highs over the weekend.
    - **Key Drivers:** Similar to gold, driven by broad market risk factors and a specific mention of US presidential actions causing weekend market chaos.
    - **Reverse Factors:** Similar to gold, a reduction in the cited macroeconomic and geopolitical risks could reverse the trend.
    - **Classification:** Long-term influencer - UP
