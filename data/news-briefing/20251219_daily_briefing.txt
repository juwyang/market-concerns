### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Commodity markets were mixed, with notable strength in energy (oil, gas), livestock (cattle), and sugar, while grains (soybeans) and softs (cocoa, arabica coffee) faced pressure.
- Geopolitical risks and technical factors (short-covering, oversold bounces) were key short-term price drivers.
- Fundamental supply prospects (favorable weather for West African cocoa, Brazilian coffee) drove longer-term bearish trends in some soft commodities.
- Anticipation of key government data (USDA Cattle on Feed report) prompted significant positioning.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical tensions contributing to volatility in energy markets.
2. Execution and sustainability risks for high-flying technology/AI stocks.
