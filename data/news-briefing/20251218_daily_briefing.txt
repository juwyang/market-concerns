### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Mixed performance across commodities: Grains (wheat, corn) rallied while softs (sugar, cocoa, coffee) fell sharply.
- Geopolitical tensions provided a floor for energy prices (crude oil), while a bearish storage report pushed natural gas lower.
- Livestock markets showed divergence, with hogs gaining and cattle falling ahead of key USDA data.
- The US Dollar strengthened modestly amid Eurozone concerns.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those affecting energy supply routes.
2. Changes in agricultural export policies from major producers (e.g., India for sugar).
3. Weather and crop development outcomes in key growing regions (West Africa for cocoa, coffee regions).
4. Eurozone fiscal stability and its impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate.

### **Watch Next**
