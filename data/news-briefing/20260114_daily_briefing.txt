### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Geopolitical Tensions Drive Energy:** Fears related to Iran provided a clear bullish catalyst for crude oil, contrasting sharply with the fundamentals-driven plunge in natural gas.
- **Softs Weaken on Supply & Demand:** Sugar and cocoa fell due to bearish fundamental shifts (higher Brazilian output and weak demand), while coffee was pressured by currency effects.
- **Livestock Divergence:** Hogs rallied powerfully on strong cash markets, while cattle pulled back awaiting cash trade direction.
- **Grains Find Specific Catalysts:** Corn found support from record ethanol data, while soybeans and wheat saw less-defined, modest gains.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical escalation in the Middle East (Iran) impacting oil supply and prices.
2. Weather volatility (warmer US temps) drastically affecting natural gas demand and storage.
3. Macro-economic currency movements (Yen strength, Brazilian Real weakness) influencing dollar and soft commodity markets.
4. Stretched valuations in specific equities (like Bloom Energy) after significant rallies.

### **Watch Next**
1. Developments in geopolitical tensions with Iran.
2. US temperature forecasts and weekly storage data for natural gas.
3. Brazilian Real (BRL) exchange rate movements.
4. Cash trade activity for live cattle.
5. Q1 cocoa grind data to confirm demand weakness.
