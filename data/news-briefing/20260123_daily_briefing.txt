### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Broad Commodity Strength:** Multiple commodities (oil, grains, cattle, coffee, metals) rallied, largely fueled by a significant decline in the US Dollar Index.
- **Export-Driven Gains:** Strong export data, particularly for corn (multi-year high) and cotton (marketing year high), provided fundamental support for grain markets.
- **Weather & Geopolitics:** A historic US winter storm supported natural gas prices, while renewed geopolitical risks were a cited factor for the crude oil rally.
- **Softs Divergence:** While coffee rose, sugar and cocoa prices fell sharply due to bearish supply/demand fundamentals, highlighting sector-specific drivers.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical tensions elevating crude oil prices.
2. Weather events (historic winter storm) driving natural gas demand and prices.
3. Slack demand and ample supplies creating sustained downward pressure on cocoa and sugar prices.
4. Potential for profit-taking after strong rallies in markets like hogs and grains.

### **Watch Next**
1. The upcoming USDA Cattle on Feed Report (mentioned in cattle articles).
2. Changes in weather patterns following the historic winter storm affecting natural gas.
3. Further developments regarding Japanese government intervention and its impact on the US Dollar/Yen.
4. Continued monitoring of export sales data for agricultural commodities.
