### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Weather-Driven Volatility:** Extreme cold in the US propelled natural gas to a multi-year high, while a winter storm was flagged as a potential catalyst for orange juice.
- **Geopolitical Sentiment Shift:** Hopes for progress in Ukraine peace talks were a primary factor pressuring crude oil prices lower.
- **Currency Influence:** Movements in the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real were key drivers for several soft commodities (sugar, coffee, cocoa) and the broader Dollar Index.
- **Agricultural Divergence:** Grains (wheat, corn) showed strength, while livestock markets were mixed and cotton weakened.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. The parabolic rally in natural gas is vulnerable to profit-taking if cold weather abates.
2. The disconnect between strong lean hog futures and a declining cash market price presents a convergence risk.
3. Coffee and sugar prices are sensitive to volatile currency movements (Brazilian Real) and changing weather forecasts.
4. Thin trading volume in the live cattle cash market creates uncertainty for futures direction.

2.  **Weather Forecasts:** For Brazil's coffee regions and ongoing US winter conditions.
