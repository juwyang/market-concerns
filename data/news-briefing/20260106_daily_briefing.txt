### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Geopolitical tension surrounding Venezuela is a primary market driver, boosting safe-haven metals (gold/silver) and lifting energy stocks on prospects for resource development.
- US Dollar strength exerted broad downward pressure on dollar-denominated commodities like crude oil and cocoa.
- Agricultural markets (Grains, Livestock) showed mixed to weaker performance, often failing to hold intraday gains, indicating a lack of decisive bullish conviction.
- Weather and currency factors (Brazilian Real) were key short-term drivers for soft commodities like coffee and sugar.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical instability, particularly the situation in Venezuela, creating market volatility.
2. Energy demand concerns posing a risk to oil prices.
3. The strong rally in precious metals being interpreted as a potential warning sign for equity markets.
