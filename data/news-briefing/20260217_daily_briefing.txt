### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Broad Commodity Weakness:** Most agricultural and soft commodities (Corn, Wheat, Cotton, Cocoa, Coffee) closed lower.
- **Livestock Outperforms:** Cattle and Hogs rallied strongly, supported by firming cash markets.
- **Energy Pressured by Geopolitics & Weather:** Crude oil fell on potential Iran deal progress, while Nat-Gas plunged on warm US forecasts.
- **Dollar Strength:** The US Dollar rose to a one-week high, buoyed by Fed rhetoric and weak equities, pressuring dollar-denominated commodities.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. **Geopolitical Supply Shock:** Progress in US-Iran nuclear talks risks adding significant new supply to the oil market (Article 8, 19).
2. **Weather-Driven Demand Volatility:** Warmer US weather forecasts are a key downside risk for Natural Gas prices (Article 9).
3. **Technical Breakdown:** Cotton prices are dangerously close to a critical technical support level, which could trigger further selling (Article 10).
4. **Demand Destruction:** Persistently high prices for softs like Cocoa are leading to a collapse in demand (Article 12).

### **Watch Next**
1. **Weather Patterns:** Conditions in South America (for grains/soy), the U.S., and Europe (for wheat) as highlighted in Article 20.
2. **Export Shipments:** USDA export data, as seen with corn shipments of 1.492 MMT (Article 6).
