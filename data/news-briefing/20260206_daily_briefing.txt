### **Summary & Key Themes**
- The US dollar weakened as stock markets rallied, providing support to some dollar-denominated commodities like crude oil.
- Several soft commodities (sugar, cocoa, coffee) faced sustained downward pressure due to structural oversupply and weak demand.
- Livestock markets showed divergence, with cattle rallying on strong cash fundamentals while hogs were mixed.
- Grain markets were mostly weaker on the day, despite some products (soybeans) holding onto strong weekly gains.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical risks are cited as a supporting factor for crude oil prices.
2. A warning that the recent oil price rally may be at risk of a sharp reversal ("rug-pull").
3. Persistent oversupply gluts in global sugar, cocoa, and coffee markets.
4. Weather volatility, seen in warm US temperatures reducing natural gas demand.

### **Watch Next**
1. Further developments in geopolitical events affecting oil.
2. US temperature forecasts and production data for natural gas.
3. Cash market activity and USDA reports for livestock.
4. Continued updates on global supply for soft commodities (sugar, cocoa, coffee).
