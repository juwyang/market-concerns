### **Summary & Key Themes**
- Geopolitical tensions (Iran, Greenland) drove safe-haven flows into gold/silver and provided support for oil prices.
- Extreme weather in the US (deep freeze) caused a massive, short-term surge in natural gas prices.
- Currency movements, particularly Brazilian Real strength, significantly influenced soft commodity prices (sugar, coffee).
- Livestock markets found support from firming cash prices for both hogs and cattle.
- Cocoa prices continued a severe downturn based on concerns over long-term demand destruction.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Geopolitical escalation involving Iran or Greenland.
2. The potential for President Trump to impose tariffs on European energy exports, affecting the dollar and trade.
3. A sustained drop in chocolate demand impacting cocoa fundamentals.
4. Weather volatility, both current (US freeze) and forecast (Brazil rains), driving energy and agricultural prices.

### **Watch Next**
1. NRG Energy's Q4 2025 earnings report and the market reaction to the anticipated profit dip.
2. Further developments in US-Europe trade rhetoric and potential tariff actions.
3. The progression of the US deep freeze and its impact on natural gas storage/demand.
