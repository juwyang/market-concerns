    - **Key Drivers:** Weaker US dollar; Tensions after the US shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea.

    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - UP

#### **Grains**
1.  **Wheat**
    - **Price Movement:** Closed mixed. Chicago SRW was steady to slightly higher, while Kansas City HRW was weaker/fractionally mixed.
    - **Key Drivers:** A stronger US dollar index pressured prices earlier in the week. Specific contracts showed varied performance.
    - **Reverse Factors:** Changes in dollar strength and global supply/demand dynamics could shift the mixed trend.
    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - DOWN (for the overall weaker trend)

2.  **Soybeans**
    - **Price Movement:** Gained, posting 4 to 5 ½ cent gains, with stronger morning trade (up 7-9 cents).
    - **Key Drivers:** Strength from Soy Oil futures gains. February is a key month for South America's soybean crop.

    - **Price Movement:** Climbed higher for a second session, with March NY cocoa up +2.14% and London up +3.04%.

    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - UP

4.  **Cotton**
    - **Price Movement:** Fell lower, down 29 to 36 points in the front months.
    - **Key Drivers:** Not explicitly stated in the closing summary, but morning articles noted pressure from a stronger dollar and lower crude oil earlier in the week.

    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - DOWN

### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Dollar-Driven Moves:** A weaker US dollar was a primary catalyst for gains in dollar-denominated commodities like crude oil, precious metals, and sugar.
- **Geopolitical & Weather Sensitivity:** Energy markets reacted to Middle East tensions, while softs (coffee, cocoa) and grains were driven by weather and crop developments in key producing regions (Brazil, Ivory Coast).
- **Strong Cash & Follow-Through in Livestock:** Hog and cattle markets saw sustained strength, supported by firm cash prices and technical buying momentum.
- **Volatility in Key Markets:** Precious metals (especially silver) and natural gas exhibited or were noted for high volatility and sharp reversals from recent extremes.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1.  Geopolitical escalation risk from US-Iran tensions in the Arabian Sea.
2.  High volatility and potential for sharp corrections in markets that have seen parabolic rallies (precious metals, natural gas).
3.  Weather risk in key agricultural regions (Brazil for soybeans/coffee, US for natural gas).

### **Watch Next**
1.  Upcoming EIA data release (mentioned in Corn article).
2.  Progress of the South American soybean crop during the critical month of February.
3.  Further developments in US-Iran tensions.
