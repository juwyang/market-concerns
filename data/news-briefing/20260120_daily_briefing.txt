    - **Price Movement:** Rose significantly. February WTI crude closed up +1.51% (+$0.90) to settle at $60.53, and February RBOB gasoline closed up +2.16% (+$0.0386).
    - **Key Drivers:** A weaker US dollar (which makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies) and reported disruptions to Black Sea oil production.
    - **Reverse Factors:** None explicitly mentioned. Early losses in the session were recovered, indicating volatility.
    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - UP

2.  **Natural Gas**
    - **Price Movement:** Soared sharply. February Nymex natural gas closed up +25.91% (+$0.804) to a 3-week high.
    - **Key Drivers:** An Arctic blast of cold weather invading the US, which is expected to increase heating demand.
    - **Reverse Factors:** None explicitly mentioned. The move is heavily tied to immediate weather forecasts.
    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - UP

#### **Grains**
1.  **Wheat**
    - **Price Movement:** Declined moderately across all markets (Chicago SRW, KC HRW, MPLS spring wheat). Losses ranged from 2 to 8 cents.
    - **Key Drivers:** General market weakness following a rally into the long weekend. No specific new driver cited for Tuesday's decline.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The market had rallied into the long weekend, suggesting the pullback could be profit-taking or consolidation.
    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - DOWN

2.  **Corn**
    - **Price Movement:** Closed mixed. Nearby contracts were fractionally to a penny lower, while other contracts were fractionally to 1.75 cents higher. The national average cash price was down 1.25 cents.
    - **Key Drivers:** Nearby contracts faced pressure, while deferred contracts saw slight gains. An article suggests bulls are showing signs of life and corn may lead a recovery from last week's bearish USDA report.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The recent bearish USDA report continues to exert pressure on the market.
    - **Classification:** Unclear

3.  **Soybeans**

    - **Classification:** Unclear

#### **Livestock**
1.  **Live Cattle**
    - **Price Movement:** Rebounded to post gains. Futures were up 22 cents to $1 on Tuesday. This follows a severe collapse on Friday due to screwworm fears.
    - **Key Drivers:** Market recovery as fundamental bullish factors (implied but not detailed in Tuesday's articles) are re-evaluated. Cash trade was noted at $232.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The underlying fear of new world screwworm cases moving closer to the US border remains a risk.
    - **Classification:** Short-term influencer - UP

    - **Key Drivers:** Same as live cattle—recovery from a panic sell-off based on fundamental re-assessment.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The ongoing screwworm disease risk in Mexico.

#### **Metals**
1.  **Precious Metals (implied)**

    - **Key Drivers:** A significant drop in the US Dollar Index, which was driven by escalating geopolitical tensions over Greenland, reviving fears of US trade confrontations.

### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Geopolitical Jitters:** Tensions over Greenland sank the US dollar and boosted haven assets like precious metals, demonstrating rapid cross-asset impact.
- **Weather-Driven Volatility:** Extreme cold in the US sent natural gas prices soaring, while beneficial rain forecasts in Brazil pressured coffee prices.
- **Supply Fundamentals Dominant:** Market-specific supply news drove sharp moves: robust Indian sugar output and weak global cocoa demand pushed those markets down, while Black Sea oil disruptions supported crude.
- **Post-Panic Rebound:** Live cattle markets rebounded as traders reassessed fundamentals following Friday's panic sell-off on animal disease fears.
- **Grain Market Uncertainty:** Grain markets (corn, soybeans, wheat) showed mixed to weaker price action as they digest last week's bearish USDA data, with some articles suggesting underlying bullish sentiment may be building.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. **Geopolitical/Trade Risk:** Escalating US tensions over Greenland could revive broader trade confrontations, impacting currency and commodity markets.
2. **Weather Risk:** Severe US winter weather poses a risk to energy demand and supply chains, while South American weather remains critical for softs and grains.
3. **Animal Disease Risk:** The spread of new world screwworm in Mexico remains a tangible threat to the US cattle industry and market stability.
4. **Demand Risk:** Weak global demand, specifically noted for cocoa, can lead to price-deflating supply surpluses.

### **Watch Next**
1. **ONEOK, Coterra Energy, and Diamondback Energy Q4 2025 Earnings Releases** (specific dates not provided, but expected "soon" or "next month").
2. **Further developments in the US-Greenland geopolitical situation** and its impact on trade rhetoric.
3. **Updated weather forecasts** for both the US (driving nat-gas demand) and Brazil (affecting coffee and soybean conditions).
