### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **USDA Report Impact:** The monthly USDA report was a key market driver, with corn rallying on bullish stocks data, while wheat and soybeans faced pressure from increased production or lack of supportive news.
- **Weather & Currency Sensitivity:** Soft commodities and energy were highly sensitive to short-term factors: weather (nat-gas, coffee), currency moves (sugar), and index flows (cocoa).
- **Pre-FOMC Caution:** Financial markets showed positioning ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting conclusion.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. Weather forecasts turning warmer, posing a downside risk to natural gas and potentially other weather-sensitive commodities.
2. Global supply dynamics, specifically fears of an oil glut and changing agricultural surplus forecasts (cocoa).
3. Currency fluctuations, particularly the Brazilian Real's impact on dollar-denominated commodities like sugar.

### **Watch Next**
1. The outcome of the 2-day FOMC meeting concluding on Wednesday.
2. Further USDA reports and updates, particularly for grains and cotton.
3. Weather developments in key agricultural regions like Brazil.
