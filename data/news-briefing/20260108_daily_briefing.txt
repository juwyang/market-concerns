### **Summary & Key Themes**
- The **US Dollar strength**, driven by positive economic data, was a dominant theme, pressuring dollar-denominated commodities like sugar and coffee.
- **Commodity Index Rebalancing** was a cited driver for price gains in oil, cocoa, and sugar (early session).
- **Weather and Demand** influenced specific markets: warm US temperatures weighed on natural gas, while energy demand strength boosted oil.
- **Livestock markets rallied** despite notes of typically weak seasonal demand in Q4.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1.  A potential breakdown of the US Dollar Index below the 98 support level, which could impact metals, stocks, and portfolios.
2.  The seasonal tendency for cattle and hog prices to decline in Q4 and early Q1 due to weaker demand after the grilling season.

### **Watch Next**
