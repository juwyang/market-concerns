### Daily Financial Briefing: 20260211

#### **Energy**
1.  **Crude Oil & Gasoline**
    - **Price Movement:** Rose significantly. March WTI crude closed up +1.05% (+0.67) and March RBOB gasoline closed up +1.01% (+0.0197).
    - **Key Drivers:** Geopolitical risks, specifically tensions involving Iran, supported prices.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. Continued price support relies on the persistence of geopolitical tensions.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - UP`

2.  **Natural Gas**
    - **Price Movement:** Rose moderately. March Nymex natural gas closed up +1.41% (+0.044), recovering from a 4-week low.
    - **Key Drivers:** Short-covering emerged in anticipation of a large weekly inventory withdrawal reported by the EIA.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The price move is dependent on the actual inventory data confirming expectations.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - UP`

#### **Grains**
1.  **Wheat**
    - **Price Movement:** Rallied. Chicago SRW futures were up 5 to 9 cents; KC HRW futures were up 5 to 8 cents.
    - **Key Drivers:** The market found some strength, pushing higher throughout the day. No specific fundamental catalyst is cited in the provided articles.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The rally appears driven by short-term market dynamics which could be reversed.
    - **Classification:** `Unclear`

2.  **Soybeans**
    - **Price Movement:** Held onto gains, rising 1 to 4 3/4 cents. Cash bean prices also increased.
    - **Key Drivers:** The market pushed higher at midday, shrugging off early weakness. Support from soymeal futures, which were $1.00 to $2.60 higher.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The lack of a clear, strong driver suggests the gains could be vulnerable to profit-taking.
    - **Classification:** `Unclear`

3.  **Corn**
    - **Price Movement:** Mixed. Nearby contracts were down fractionally to 1.5 cents, while new crop contracts saw gains of 1 to 2.25 cents.
    - **Key Drivers:** The market saw spreading activity, with weakness in nearby contracts and strength in new crop. The average close for December 2025 corn futures was noted as a technical indicator.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The divergent price action between old and new crop indicates uncertainty.
    - **Classification:** `Unclear`

#### **Livestock**
1.  **Live Cattle**
    - **Price Movement:** Rallied strongly. Contracts were up $2.50 to $3.55.
    - **Key Drivers:** Futures were back in rally mode. Cash trade was quiet, with only a few sales reported at $243 in Kansas.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The rally occurred despite quiet cash trade, which may limit upside or lead to a correction if cash doesn't follow.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - UP`

2.  **Lean Hogs**
    - **Price Movement:** Extended losses. Contracts were down 55 cents to $1.65 (except nearby February, which was up a nickel).
    - **Key Drivers:** The market continued its downward trend from earlier in the week.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The national base hog price was reported higher ($88.17, up from prior days), which is a supportive factor that did not prevent futures losses.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - DOWN`

#### **Metals**
1.  **Gold & Silver**
    - **Price Movement:** The articles do not specify a price change for the day. They note that prices did not fall despite a strong jobs report.
    - **Key Drivers:** Underlying supply and demand fundamentals remained strong, offsetting the typical negative impact of a strong jobs report (which reduces Fed rate cut chances).
    - **Reverse Factors:** A consistently strong economic data stream could continue to dampen expectations for imminent Fed rate cuts, applying traditional downward pressure.
    - **Classification:** `Long-term influencer - UP`

#### **Softs**
1.  **Sugar**
    - **Price Movement:** Fell sharply. March NY sugar closed down -1.98% and March London sugar closed down -2.74%, extending a 3-month selloff.
    - **Key Drivers:** Robust global supplies and the outlook for persistent global sugar surpluses.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The driver is a fundamental, persistent oversupply.
    - **Classification:** `Long-term influencer - DOWN`

2.  **Cocoa**
    - **Price Movement:** Fell moderately. March NY cocoa closed down -1.13%, extending a six-week plunge to a multi-year low.
    - **Key Drivers:** Plentiful supplies and weak demand.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. The driver is a fundamental oversupply and demand issue.
    - **Classification:** `Long-term influencer - DOWN`

3.  **Coffee**
    - **Price Movement:** Rebound slightly. March arabica closed up +0.20% and March robusta closed up +0.43%, recovering from early losses.
    - **Key Drivers:** Strength in the Brazilian Real. Earlier in the day, prices were pressured by an improving global supply outlook.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The improving global supply outlook remains a bearish factor that could reassert pressure.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - UP`

#### **Currencies & Stocks**
1.  **US Dollar**
    - **Price Movement:** Gained slightly. The dollar index (DXY) finished up +0.08%, recovering from a 1.5-week low.
    - **Key Drivers:** A better-than-expected US January payroll report, which pushed Treasury note yields higher and dampened expectations for a near-term Fed rate cut.
    - **Reverse Factors:** The articles do not mention specific reverse factors. Future economic data releases will continue to shape Fed policy expectations.
    - **Classification:** `Short-term influencer - UP`

### **Summary & Key Themes**
- **Jobs Data Drives Macro Sentiment:** A stronger-than-expected US jobs report lifted the US Dollar and Treasury yields, reshaping near-term Fed policy expectations.
- **Geopolitics Support Energy:** Crude oil prices found strength from geopolitical tensions, overshadowing other market factors.
- **Softs Under Fundamental Pressure:** Sugar and cocoa extended prolonged declines due to well-supplied markets and weak demand.
- **Grain Markets Exhibit Mixed Dynamics:** Wheat and soybeans gained without a clear catalyst, while corn saw divergent price action between old and new crop contracts.
- **Livestock Markets Diverge:** Cattle rallied strongly while hogs extended losses, despite a higher reported cash hog price.

### **Risks Highlighted**
1. **Geopolitical Risk:** Tensions involving Iran are supporting crude oil prices and present an upside risk to energy costs.
2. **Persistent Oversupply:** Structural surpluses in global sugar and cocoa markets are driving prolonged price declines.
3. **Fed Policy Uncertainty:** Strong economic data is reducing the likelihood of near-term interest rate cuts, creating volatility for rate-sensitive assets like the dollar.

### **Watch Next**
1. **EIA Natural Gas Storage Report:** The anticipated large inventory withdrawal that supported nat-gas prices.
2. **Cash Cattle Trade:** Further developments in cash market activity to see if it confirms the strength in live cattle futures.
3. **Continued Geopolitical Developments:** Any escalation or de-escalation in the tensions cited as supporting crude oil.
